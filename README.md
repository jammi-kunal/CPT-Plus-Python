# CPT-Plus-Python
The first implementation of the CPT+ algorithm in python on the internet. A very basic one. Needs to be a bit more touched up and in a few more versions can give excellent results. Better than the original java project due to the presence of different libraries such as Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib etc which make working with arrays and data sets a lot faster. This is just a basic implementation of the original java code. Find the original implementation and more details about the algorithm at at: https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CPTPlus.php

This whole project was developed on google colab. Very easy to use and work with. And gives amazing computational results.

So, the training data of this code is stored in 'test_cpt_data12.csv'. You can modify that file according to your whims and fancy. 

The project also stores all the outputs in a log file, 'predictions.txt'. It has all the outputs of most of the executions till now. 

The sequences for which the prediction needs to be done is stored in 'targetData.csv'. 

To run the project, just open the exe.ipynb file and execute the very first block.
