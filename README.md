# CPT-Plus-Python

The first implementation of the CPT+ algorithm in python on the internet.
This algorithm helps in predicting the next element in a sequence.
This can be used for predicting the next webpage a user will visit based on his previous webpage visits.

This is just a basic implementation of the original java code. Find the original implementation and more details about the algorithm at at: https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CPTPlus.php

This whole project was developed on Google Colaboratory.

So, the training data of this code is stored in 'test_cpt_data12.csv'. 
The project also stores all the outputs in a log file, 'predictions.txt'. It has all the outputs of most of the executions till now. 
The sequences for which the prediction needs to be done is stored in 'targetData.csv'. 

To run the project, just open the exe.ipynb file and execute the very first block.
