# CPT-Plus-Python
The first implementation of the CPT+ algorithm on the internet. A very basic one. Needs to be a bit more touched up and in a fewer versions can give excellent results. Better than the original java project due to the presence of different libraries such as Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib etc which make working with arrays and data sets a lot faster. This is just a basic implementation of the original java code. Find the original implementation and more details about the algorithm at at: https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CPTPlus.php
