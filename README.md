# CPT-Plus-Python

The first implementation of the CPT+ algorithm in python on the internet.

This algorithm helps in predicting the next element in a sequence.

This can be used for tasks like predicting the next webpage a user will visit based on his previous webpage visits.

So, the training data of this code is stored in 'test_cpt_data12.csv'. 
The project also stores all the outputs in a log file, 'predictions.txt'. It has all the outputs of most of the executions till now. 
The sequences for which the prediction needs to be done is stored in 'targetData.csv'. 

To run the project, just open the exe.ipynb file and execute the very first block.
